# Aruco symbol positioning and localization algorithm
Files that are included in this repository represent the main code of the semester degree thesis.
The main task of this algorthym is to recognize the ArUco symobls, write their coordinates to the files.
Show the localization of each symbol, in coordinates system compare to the camera position.
